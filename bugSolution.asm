mov ecx, array_size ;Load the size of the array into ecx
mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ;Access memory only within the array bounds
; Check for array bounds before accessing it
cmp ecx, 0 ; Check if array is empty
je error_handler ; Handle the case if the array is empty
;Check if ecx is greater than the array size

mov DWORD PTR [eax], ebx ;This instruction could overwrite a critical memory location if the value of eax points to an area not meant for writing, leading to a program crash or data corruption. Add checks here to ensure safety.

;Correct use of registers
push eax ;Pushes the current value of eax onto the stack
push ebx ;Pushes the current value of ebx onto the stack
add eax, ebx ;adds the value of eax and ebx storing the result in eax
pop ebx ;Pops a value from the stack into ebx
pop eax ;Pops a value from the stack into eax
;The problem here is that the order of pop operations is wrong and it will lead to wrong values being restored into eax and ebx. The fix is to reverse the order of pop instructions to match push order.
